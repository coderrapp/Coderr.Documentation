Context collections
===================

Context collections, or telemetry data, is part of the core in Coderr. These collections allow you to quickly and accurately diagnose errors.
Most of them are generated by Coderr when a new error is detected. 

## Adding context data

* To manually add context data, read the [reporting](/features/reporting) guide.
* To let Coderr automatically generate custom data, create a [custom context provider](/client/extending/contextprovider/)

## Examples

The integration libraries have generated these:
